<h1 align="center">This is Budha</h1>
<h3 align="left">I care about making data accessible, ethical, and powerful across public policy, development data, and product teams, especially in transforming messy data into meaningful decisions.

With a solid background of 7+ years in Business Intelligence (T-SQL, Oracle PL/SQL, RDBMS, MyBI, SSIS) and a deep interest in the intersection of data, development, and decision-making, I'm currently exploring: data quality assurance, data journalism, development data, and story-driven analytics. Open to collaborations, research, or roles where data meets meaning.

I have also trained myself on Tableau, Power BI, Python, D3.js & AWS Cloud in last one year and worked on a few projects.
