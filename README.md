<h1 align="center">This is Budha</h1>
<h4 align="left">I care about making data accessible, ethical, and powerful across public policy, development data, and product teams, especially in transforming messy data into meaningful decisions.
<br><br>
With a solid background of 7+ years in Business Intelligence (T-SQL, Oracle PL/SQL, RDBMS, MyBI, SSIS) and a deep interest in the intersection of data, development, and decision-making, I'm currently exploring: data quality assurance, data journalism, development data, and story-driven analytics. Open to collaborations, research, or roles where data meets meaning.
<br><br>
I have also trained myself on Tableau, Power BI, Python, D3.js & AWS Cloud in last one year and worked on a few projects.</h4>

- I’m currently working on **creating Electors dataset across Assembly Constituencies in India** and identify **UDISE+ data-driven insights** to justify the school drop-out rate. 

- I’m currently learning **D3.js, QGIS**

- I’m looking forward to work with **Open Government Data & Social Sector Analytics, Data storytelling, Business Intelligence, Data Visualisation, Ethical AI, Transparency, or Policy Research, Health & Development**
